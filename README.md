Function
1. Write a function add that adds an element to the end of an array. 
   However, the element should only be added if it is not already in the array.
2. Write a function addTo that accepts a number as a parameter and adds all
   natural numbers smaller or equal than the parameter. The result is to be 
   returned. Example: addTo(3) should return 1+2+3 = 6.
3. Write a function mean that accepts an array filled with numbers and 
   returns the arithmetic mean of those numbers.
